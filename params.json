{"name":"Web Application for Personal Development","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nAs of 5/18/2012 this page is being generated. Watch this space for updates and additions rolling forward!\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is authored using GitHub Flavored Markdown with the template and hosting offered gratis by GitHub for open source projects. After the GitHub page page is generated, one can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating your own Custom Page\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n###Happy Trails!\r\n\r\n###","tagline":"Repository for an adaptive personal achievement system.","google":"UA-31866061-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
